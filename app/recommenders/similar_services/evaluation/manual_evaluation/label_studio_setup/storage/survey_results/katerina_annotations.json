A major objective and challenge in SeaDataNet is to promote discoverability of these data resources in a consistent and comprehensive manner. This is achieved through the SeaDataNet metadata services a set of directories, with associated user interfaces and web services, each governed by a SeaDataNet partner and content provided through national SeaDataNet collating nodes. The European Directory of Ocean-Observing Systems (EDIOS) is the SeaDataNet catalogue promoting discoverability of, and access to, ocean measuring and monitoring systems operated by European countries. EDIOS is an initiative of the European Global Ocean Observing System (EuroGOOS) and helps to maintain visibility of continuously available data sets for operational modelling purposes and supports implementation of the European Unions Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). EDIOS presents users with three main tiers of information: monitoring i) programmes, ii) platforms and iii) series\/stations. The catalogue utilises a metadata format based upon the ISO 19115 content model. The EDIOS Schema and XML coding are supported by URLs and URNs to the SeaDataNet Common Vocabularies.For communities who need information about marine monitoring initiatives operated by European countriesMore than 110 data providers (linked to more than 600 data originators) and several thousands of data users",

Create disposable testing and development environments on virtual machines and scale your infrastructure needs. Select virtual machine configurations (CPU, memory, disk) and application environments to fit your requirements. Manage your Cloud Compute resources in a flexible way with integrated monitoring and accounting capabilities.",

The VRE hosts examples of suitable habitat maps produced for today and 2050 in new areas for more than 11, 000 species and provides models and workflows to combine environmental data with species observations in their habitats to predict their future spread. ### Features: - A service providing state-of-the art Data Analytics algorithms suitable for alien and invasive species spread prediction; - A service for seamless discovery and access to species occurrence data and taxa names from several providers providers (eg. BrazilianFlora, OBIS, WoRMS, GBIF, ITIS, CatalogueOfLife); - A complete spatial data infrastructure for discovering, accessing and publishing spatial datasets according to OGC standards; - A catalogue service for discovering, accessing and publishing any research object (multi-part objects with actionable parts) and promoting its re-use; - A social networking service supporting communication among VRE members by sharing and commenting posts;",

Rewarded an API Award for the category “Data APIs” in 2017, it is an automated and flexible method of access and retrieval of the Europeana Collections. The Europeana REST API set includes the following services: Search API, Record API, Entity API, IIIF API, OAI-PMH and SPARQL services. Next in development is the Annotations API, seen as a high-potential service for research audiences. All Europeana API services are free of charge and require a simple registration. Europeana provides extensive API documentation on https:\/\/pro.europeana.eu\/resources\/apis and support via a dedicated Google Group and email. Sharing best practices with regard to data publication and access adds extra value to the Europeana offer. Featured examples include the Europeana Data Model https:\/\/pro.europeana.eu\/resources\/standardization-tools\/edm-documentation) which streamlines the aggregation of cultural data from across Europe, Europeana Publishing Framework https:\/\/pro.europeana.eu\/post\/publishing-framework, and other work related to the FAIR principles for research data (see publication below) https:\/\/pro.europeana.eu\/post\/europeana-and-the-fair-principles-for-research-data.",

GEO DAB is a brokering framework that interconnects hundreds of heterogeneous and autonomous supply systems (the enterprise systems constituting the GEO metasystem) by providing mediation, harmonization, transformation, and QoS capabilities. GEO DAB can be accessed using several web service interfaces, available at [link][1].

      "description": "Aila is Finnish Social Science Data Archive’s (FSD) online data discovery, deposit and download service. Aila facilitates access to research data from the social sciences and related fields. \n\nEveryone can download data online from Aila according to the conditions set for each dataset. Some data are available for all users under the Creative Commons BY 4.0 license and for the rest registration in advance is required. Everyone can freely search, filter and browse rich study descriptions of archived data in Finnish and in English. This includes not only descriptive metadata but variable level metadata and frequencies as well. Data download is always free of charge. Students and staff from the Finnish higher education and research institutions can register themselves using HAKA identity federation. Other users apply for a username from FSD User Services. \n\nDatasets may be deposited to Aila according to FSD's collection policy. Both quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (i.e. text, speech, or visual images) data collected for research purposes are accepted. A prerequisite for archiving is that the data can be reused at least for research purposes. Aila features a secure transfer service for data file(s) and data description as well as other material, such as the questionnaire, coding instructions and interview questions. \n\nFSD takes care of long-term preservation and access to the data through Aila. Especially quantitative and qualitative research data from and about Finland are available through Aila and data may be translated into English for on request.\n\nThe service helps to\n- save time and resource for researchers when accessing data\n- increase visibility and merit, and verification of research through increased data citation\n- avoid overlapping data collection or recollection of data + reduce potential duplication of effort\n- secure value to future researchers and students intervention\n- provide more equal and easy access to metadata and data\n- facilitate use of data by new audiences\n- provide well curated and documented data\n- preserve data for the long term\n- enable comparative and multidisciplinary research\n- facilitate verification and reproducibility of research\n- remove user burden from data depositors\n- facilitate open science\n- motivate new research.",

This metadata comprise the main concepts found in resources containing text, the main knowledge areas in which these concepts are most frequently used, the main expressions, known in computational linguistics as noun phrases, found in the text, and named entities that are further classified in people, organization and places. The core of the semantic enrichment process is expert.ai software. Expert.ai uses a proprietary semantic network, where words are grouped into concepts with other words sharing the same meaning, and the concepts are related between them by linguistic relations such as hypernyms or hyponyms among many others. Therefore, the semantics of the generated metadata is explicit since the concepts are grounded to the semantic network.\n\nInformation retrieval processes, including search engines and recommender systems, can benefit of working with concepts instead of character strings representing words, mainly to provide a more complete and accurate set of results, and enabling the exploration of file collections by means of facets where the semantic metadata is available.",

The main features of the service are the following:\n- set-valued species classification: the service returns the list of species corresponding to the query, each associated with the probability output by the deep learning model \n- similarity search: the service returns the closest pictures to the query which allows the user to visually control the returned species\n- multi-images & multi-organ queries \n- updated training set: Pl@ntNet model is regularly updated with new knowledge and revised collaboratively\n- secured access service with an API key\n- automated reject of non-plant images including pornographic contents, faces, personal objects, etc. \n- service usage dashboard (statistics, keys, quotas, etc.)\n- a complete usage documentation \n- scalability (the service is currently used by 500K users per day) \n- identification quality monitoring and non-regression guaranty \n- Quality-of-service: advanced monitoring tools, automatic restart\n",

The Guardomic allows to control it automatically or manually. If you choose to control the solution manually, it provides advanced monitoring and helps decide to block suspicious traffic, or allow it. Because of big impact on hardware performance, limiting or blocking of bot traffic in many cases the can save cost of an unnecessary hardware upgrade.",
