Active research data management (ARDM) is the process of organising data during an ongoing research project (data annotation, storage and backup).\n\nThe service is based around the ARDM platform [openBIS](https:\/\/openbis.ch\/), developed for the last 12 years by the Scientific IT Services of Informatikdienste (ID SIS) at ETH Zurich. openBIS is a server-client application: the remote server hosts the database and storage backends which are accessed by the users from their local machines via a web browser. **openBIS** combines a data management platform with a digital lab notebook and a sample and protocol management system. It enables scientists to meet the ever-increasing requirements from funding agencies, journals, and academic institutions to publish data according to the **FAIR** data principles – according to which data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. The system is available in a version specific for life sciences and in a generic version, customizable for other scientific disciplines. ",

A major objective and challenge in SeaDataNet is to promote discoverability of these data resources in a consistent and comprehensive manner. This is achieved through the SeaDataNet metadata services a set of directories, with associated user interfaces and web services, each governed by a SeaDataNet partner and content provided through national SeaDataNet collating nodes. The European Directory of Ocean-Observing Systems (EDIOS) is the SeaDataNet catalogue promoting discoverability of, and access to, ocean measuring and monitoring systems operated by European countries. EDIOS is an initiative of the European Global Ocean Observing System (EuroGOOS) and helps to maintain visibility of continuously available data sets for operational modelling purposes and supports implementation of the European Unions Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). EDIOS presents users with three main tiers of information: monitoring i) programmes, ii) platforms and iii) series\/stations. The catalogue utilises a metadata format based upon the ISO 19115 content model. The EDIOS Schema and XML coding are supported by URLs and URNs to the SeaDataNet Common Vocabularies.For communities who need information about marine monitoring initiatives operated by European countriesMore than 110 data providers (linked to more than 600 data originators) and several thousands of data users",

Aila facilitates access to research data from the social sciences and related fields. \n\nEveryone can download data online from Aila according to the conditions set for each dataset. Some data are available for all users under the Creative Commons BY 4.0 license and for the rest registration in advance is required. Everyone can freely search, filter and browse rich study descriptions of archived data in Finnish and in English. This includes not only descriptive metadata but variable level metadata and frequencies as well. Data download is always free of charge. Students and staff from the Finnish higher education and research institutions can register themselves using HAKA identity federation. Other users apply for a username from FSD User Services. \n\nDatasets may be deposited to Aila according to FSD's collection policy. Both quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (i.e. text, speech, or visual images) data collected for research purposes are accepted. A prerequisite for archiving is that the data can be reused at least for research purposes. Aila features a secure transfer service for data file(s) and data description as well as other material, such as the questionnaire, coding instructions and interview questions. \n\nFSD takes care of long-term preservation and access to the data through Aila. Especially quantitative and qualitative research data from and about Finland are available through Aila and data may be translated into English for on request.\n\nThe service helps to\n- save time and resource for researchers when accessing data\n- increase visibility and merit, and verification of research through increased data citation\n- avoid overlapping data collection or recollection of data + reduce potential duplication of effort\n- secure value to future researchers and students intervention\n- provide more equal and easy access to metadata and data\n- facilitate use of data by new audiences\n- provide well curated and documented data\n- preserve data for the long term\n- enable comparative and multidisciplinary research\n- facilitate verification and reproducibility of research\n- remove user burden from data depositors\n- facilitate open science\n- motivate new research.",

In particular, the environment is powered by RStudio®, an open source development environment including a code editor, and debugging and visualization tools. Moreover, this VRE is powered by the gCube data analytics platform and allows to perform the following tasks: Integrate R algorithms into the platform; Execute integrated algorithms by benefitting from a distributed computing infrastructure Automatically generate research objects out of any computation In addition to the basic functionalities, as a workspace for sharing objects of interest, a social networking area for supporting the discussions among members and a user management facility for managing membership, this VLab is specifically equipped with the following capabilities: - Geospatial Data View: a facility enabling users to discover and visualize GIS layers, e.g. species distribution maps that have been generated and published. This facility relies on the GeoExplorer portlet and makes it possible to effectively exploit the generated maps and perform comparisons and analysis of the diverse distributions by enabling maps overlay, transects production and values inspection; - Data Analytics at Scale: a facility enabling users to benefit from the offering of the DataMiner service and interactively execute a large array of data analytics tasks on datasets. These algorithms range from trajectory simulations based on the Ichthyop model to Virtual Population Analysis (VPA) Algorithms, spatial reallocation, ensemble model-based approaches Algorithm Importer: a facility enabling users to transform R-based algorithms and methods into DataMiner algorithms, i.e. methods that can be executed by the data analytics platform. This transformation assists in annotating the code thus making it possible for Data Miner to properly execute it R Studio as-a-Service: a facility enabling users to access a fully-fledged RStudio® working environment directly from the VRE. This environment is integrated with the rest of VRE facilities enabling the usage of files from the workspace and the storage of new files into the workspace",

A big part of our system are in-depth statistics, allowing our clients to be conscious about their traffic. The solution helps to defend from unwanted bot traffic and dangerous ad-fraud. The Guardomic allows to control it automatically or manually. If you choose to control the solution manually, it provides advanced monitoring and helps decide to block suspicious traffic, or allow it. Because of big impact on hardware performance, limiting or blocking of bot traffic in many cases the can save cost of an unnecessary hardware upgrade.",
