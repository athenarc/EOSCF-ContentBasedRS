Active research data management (ARDM) is the process of organising data during an ongoing research project (data annotation, storage and backup).\n\nThe service is based around the ARDM platform [openBIS](https:\/\/openbis.ch\/), developed for the last 12 years by the Scientific IT Services of Informatikdienste (ID SIS) at ETH Zurich. openBIS is a server-client application: the remote server hosts the database and storage backends which are accessed by the users from their local machines via a web browser. **openBIS** combines a data management platform with a digital lab notebook and a sample and protocol management system. It enables scientists to meet the ever-increasing requirements from funding agencies, journals, and academic institutions to publish data according to the **FAIR** data principles – according to which data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. The system is available in a version specific for life sciences and in a generic version, customizable for other scientific disciplines. ",

EDMED covers a wide range of disciplines including marine meteorology; physical, chemical and biological oceanography; and marine geology and geophysics. Data sets are described in EDMED irrespective of their format. EDMED utilises a metadata format based upon the ISO 19115 content model.

The VRE hosts examples of suitable habitat maps produced for today and 2050 in new areas for more than 11, 000 species and provides models and workflows to combine environmental data with species observations in their habitats to predict their future spread. ### Features: - A service providing state-of-the art Data Analytics algorithms suitable for alien and invasive species spread prediction; - A service for seamless discovery and access to species occurrence data and taxa names from several providers providers (eg. BrazilianFlora, OBIS, WoRMS, GBIF, ITIS, CatalogueOfLife); - A complete spatial data infrastructure for discovering, accessing and publishing spatial datasets according to OGC standards; - A catalogue service for discovering, accessing and publishing any research object (multi-part objects with actionable parts) and promoting its re-use; - A social networking service supporting communication among VRE members by sharing and commenting posts;",

The Query-Store gathers all the queries of VAMDC, together with the produced results and relevant bibliographic information. This service succeeded in removing the technical barriers linked with the automatic data-citation and with the delegation of credits for VAMDC-extracted data. : scientists may extract data from VAMDC, assign a DOI to those Data and cite them in publication through this DOI. Tha data-authors will receive automatically bibliographic credits via Scholix. Other Research Infrastructure may commission VAMDC for porting our solution to their particular use case. The adopted approach is transdisciplinar and may be adopted by other E-infrastructure, ESFRI or ERICs. No kind of limitation",

Rewarded an API Award for the category “Data APIs” in 2017, it is an automated and flexible method of access and retrieval of the Europeana Collections. The Europeana REST API set includes the following services: Search API, Record API, Entity API, IIIF API, OAI-PMH and SPARQL services. Next in development is the Annotations API, seen as a high-potential service for research audiences. All Europeana API services are free of charge and require a simple registration. Europeana provides extensive API documentation on https:\/\/pro.europeana.eu\/resources\/apis and support via a dedicated Google Group and email. Sharing best practices with regard to data publication and access adds extra value to the Europeana offer. Featured examples include the Europeana Data Model https:\/\/pro.europeana.eu\/resources\/standardization-tools\/edm-documentation) which streamlines the aggregation of cultural data from across Europe, Europeana Publishing Framework https:\/\/pro.europeana.eu\/post\/publishing-framework, and other work related to the FAIR principles for research data (see publication below) https:\/\/pro.europeana.eu\/post\/europeana-and-the-fair-principles-for-research-data.",

This metadata comprise the main concepts found in resources containing text, the main knowledge areas in which these concepts are most frequently used, the main expressions, known in computational linguistics as noun phrases, found in the text, and named entities that are further classified in people, organization and places. The core of the semantic enrichment process is expert.ai software. Expert.ai uses a proprietary semantic network, where words are grouped into concepts with other words sharing the same meaning, and the concepts are related between them by linguistic relations such as hypernyms or hyponyms among many others. Therefore, the semantics of the generated metadata is explicit since the concepts are grounded to the semantic network.\n\nInformation retrieval processes, including search engines and recommender systems, can benefit of working with concepts instead of character strings representing words, mainly to provide a more complete and accurate set of results, and enabling the exploration of file collections by means of facets where the semantic metadata is available.",

In particular, the environment is powered by RStudio®, an open source development environment including a code editor, and debugging and visualization tools. Moreover, this VRE is powered by the gCube data analytics platform and allows to perform the following tasks: Integrate R algorithms into the platform; Execute integrated algorithms by benefitting from a distributed computing infrastructure Automatically generate research objects out of any computation In addition to the basic functionalities, as a workspace for sharing objects of interest, a social networking area for supporting the discussions among members and a user management facility for managing membership, this VLab is specifically equipped with the following capabilities: - Geospatial Data View: a facility enabling users to discover and visualize GIS layers, e.g. species distribution maps that have been generated and published. This facility relies on the GeoExplorer portlet and makes it possible to effectively exploit the generated maps and perform comparisons and analysis of the diverse distributions by enabling maps overlay, transects production and values inspection; - Data Analytics at Scale: a facility enabling users to benefit from the offering of the DataMiner service and interactively execute a large array of data analytics tasks on datasets. These algorithms range from trajectory simulations based on the Ichthyop model to Virtual Population Analysis (VPA) Algorithms, spatial reallocation, ensemble model-based approaches Algorithm Importer: a facility enabling users to transform R-based algorithms and methods into DataMiner algorithms, i.e. methods that can be executed by the data analytics platform. This transformation assists in annotating the code thus making it possible for Data Miner to properly execute it R Studio as-a-Service: a facility enabling users to access a fully-fledged RStudio® working environment directly from the VRE. This environment is integrated with the rest of VRE facilities enabling the usage of files from the workspace and the storage of new files into the workspace",

The Collabwith Marketplace includes a marketplace for collaboration opportunities and knowledge sharing and technology for an effective knowledge transfer and collaboration efficiency such as smart legal contracts to reduce bureaucracy and protect data and protect “knowledge sharing” activities with NDAs with specific clauses for IP, ethics and competition protection. The objective of Collabwith Marketplace is to serve the scientific community and scientific providers with tools to share and transfer effectively their knowledge, research results and scientific services directly to industry and society. Inside the Collabwith Marketplace scientifics find challenges and technology (TRL3-9) from industry, SMEs and startups, services from industry, products from industry ready to test, open questions from scientifics where they seek other technology and research results from scientifics and funding calls.",
